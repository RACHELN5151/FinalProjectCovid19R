My covid19 project Presents the covid new cases and deaths in the world.
we can see that in the countries who vaccinated the population the numbers of covid19 new cases are very low and that the numbers of deaths as well. 
The projet gives information in the aspect of continent, countries, new cases, new deaths, vaccination by age group.
the user can choose the period, continent or country and see the new cases or deaths.

We can see that Isreal is in a vary good condition comparing to other countries.
